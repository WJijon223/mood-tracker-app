          Mental wellbeing is a journey, not a destination. ðŸŒ± Some days might
          feel harder than others, and thatâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s important to remember
          that small steps, like taking a break, practicing gratitude, or
          reaching out to a friend, can make a big difference over time. Your
          feelings are valid, and you donâ€™t have to face them alone. Be kind to
          yourself todayâ€”youâ€™re doing the best you can. ðŸ’› #MentalWellbeing
